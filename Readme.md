# DiaSymbolView

**DiaSymbolView** is a tool for visually inspecting debug information recorded in `.pdb` files. It relies on [MSDIA API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/debug-interface-access/debug-interface-access-sdk) and presents a hierarchy of debug symbols and their 200+ properties.

You can download the binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/diversenok/DiaSymbolView/releases). To build the tool yourself, follow instructions in Compiling.md
